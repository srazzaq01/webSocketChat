# webSocketChat
A chat program created using websockets
The first file is a simple html file. In that web app I am creating a websocket connection to a python server, then sending the message as a json. 
The server then sends the message back after verifying the content. Using jquery, the client listens for a message from the server, and then outputs the
message onto the web app.
